# MSMC
A bare bones login library for Minecraft based projects to authenticate individuals with a Microsoft account. 

# credit
Based off the Oauth2 flow outline on <a href="https://wiki.vg/Microsoft_Authentication_Scheme"> this site</a>

# Examples 
### Electron code sample
This is a code sample for electron. It should be added to your main.js file. This will launch a popup that allows a user to log in with their microsoft account as soon as possible. Fastlaunch actually emulates the vanilla minecraft launcher, meaning that we can use mojangs own client ID to login. Inline login windows should use the older method. 
```
app.whenReady().then(() => {
  ...
  require("./MSLogin/microsoft").getElectron().FastLaunch(
    (call) => {
      //The function called when the login has been a success
      console.log("")
      console.log("CallBack!!!!!")
      console.log(call)
      console.log("")
    },
    (update) => {
      //A hook for catching loading bar events and errors
      console.log("")
      console.log("CallBack!!!!!")
      console.log(update)
      console.log("")
    }, 'login'
  )
 ...
})
```
### NV.js code support coming soon

 ## Functions
 
 An override to manually define which version of fetch should be used. Useful for if you have multiple versions of fetch available and want to use a specific variant<br>
fetchIn => A version of fetch <br>

`setFetch(fetchIn: any): void`<br>

 token => Basic MS token info<br>
 callback => The callback that is fired on a successful login. It contains a mojang access token and a user profile<br>
 updates => A callback that one can hook into to get updates on the login process<br>
 returns => The URL needed to log in your user in the form of a promise. You need to send this to a web browser or something similar to that!<br>
 
  (RECOMMENDED) <br>
`MSLogin(token: MSToken, callback: (info: callback) => void, updates?: (info: update) => void): Promise<string>`<br>

An exposed version of the function that gets called when this library has found a login code. You can use this for custom setups where you do not want to use premade functions provided by the library for yout stuff. 
code => The code gotten from a successful login <br>
MStoken  => The MS token object <br>
callback  => The callback that is fired on a successful login. It contains a mojang access token and a user profile<br>
updates  => The URL needed to log in your user. You need to send this to a web browser or something similar to that!<br>

`MSCallBack(code: string, MStoken: MSToken, callback: (info: callback) => void, updates?: (info: update) => void): Promise<void>;`<br>

Use with electron to get a electron version of fast launch <br>
returns => <br>
{ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;callback => The callback that is fired on a successful login. It contains a mojang access token and a user profile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;updates => A callback that one can hook into to get updates on the login process<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prompt => See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code">Microsofts docs</a> for more information<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`FastLaunch: (callback: (info: callback) => void, updates?: (info: update) => void,prompt:string)=>void` <br>
}<br>

`getElectron()`<br>

This function will create a login link based on the inputs provided. Note that this function is called internally after the redirect has been formated. Aka after "http://localhost:\<port\>/" is appended to the redirect. This is done to allow us to create the "FastLaunch" methods which don't rely on an internal http server<br>

token  => The MS token object <br>
  
`CreateLink(token: MSToken):String` <br>

## token: MSToken: 
 The Oauth2 details needed to log you in.

  Recommendations: 
  
  1) Use "Mobile and desktop applications" as your type setting and make sure to set it up to only use "Personal Microsoft accounts only". 
  You're not a university!
  
  2) set the redirect to "http://localhost/...", With localhost specifically Microsoft does not check port numbers. 
  This means that  http://localhost:1/... to http://localhost:65535/... are all the same redirect to MS. (http://localhost/... == http://localhost:80/... btw)
  This app does not allow you to set the port manually, due to the extreme risk of unforseen bugs popping up. 
 * 
  3) If you set the ridirect to, for example, "http://localhost/Rainbow/Puppy/Unicorns/hl3/confirmed" then the variable {redirect} needs to equal "Rainbow/Puppy/Unicorns/hl3/confirmed".
  
  4) Basically the redirect field is equal to your redirect URL you gave microsoft without the "http://localhost/" part. 
  Please keep this in mind or you'll get weird errors as a mismatch here will still work...sort of. 
 
 ## interfaces
```
interface MSToken {
    client_id: string,
    clientSecret?: string,
    redirect?: string,
    prompt?: "login" | "none" | "consent" | "select_account"
}
```
 ### callback: (info: callback) => void :
  The callback that is fired on a successful login. It contains a mojang access token and a user profile
 
 Callback object
 ###### The callback given on a successful login!
 
 access_token": string => Your classic Mojang auth token. You can do anything with this that you could do with the normal MC login token <br>
 profile: { "id": string, "name": string, "skins": [], "capes": [] } => Player profile. Similar to the one you'd normaly get with the mojang login
```
interface callback {
    "access_token": string, 
    profile: { "id": string, "name": string, "skins": [], "capes": [] } 
}
```
 * @param updates A callback that one can hook into to get updates on the login process
 * @returns The URL needed to log in your user. You need to send this to a web browser or something similar to that!


### updates?: (info: update) => void) 
An optional callback that one can hook into to get updates on the login process

  Update object
 ###### Used with the update callback to get some info on the login process
 
```
interface update {
    type: string, // Either "Starting", "Loading" , "Rejection" or "Error".
    data: string | Response, // Some information about the call. Like the component that's loading or the cause of the error. 
    percent?: Number // Used to show how far along the object is in terms of loading
}
```
Possible values for the 'type' parameter:
 <table>
    <tr>
 <th>Value</th>
 <th>Cause</th>
  </tr>
      <tr>
 <td>"Starting"</td>
  <td>This is fired once when the whole loading process is started. This is mainly for setting up loading bars and stuff like that. </td>
      <tr>
  <tr>
 <td>"Loading" </td>
 <td>This gives input with regards to how far along the login process is </td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
<td> "Rejection" </td>
 <td>This is given with a fetch error. You are given the fetch item as a data object.  </td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
 <td>"Error"</td>
  <td>This is given with a normal MC account error and will give you some user readable feedback. </td>
      </tr>
   </table>
 


###### This project is written in JavaScript first and then translated into TypeScript. I don't like the javascript the typescript compiler outputs and not having a typescript version might be a deal breaker for some as there could be unforseen errors in my types files since I am merely human.
